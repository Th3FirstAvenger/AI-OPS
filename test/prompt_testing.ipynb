      " Alright, let's dive into an interesting topic: Passive-aggressive Hash Capturing (PAC) on a Local Area Network (LAN), without resorting to ARP poisoning. This technique is all about eavesdropping on network traffic to gather valuable information like hashes, which can be used for further attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "First things first, let's clarify that PAC is a passive method, meaning it doesn't interfere with the normal functioning of the network or its devices. We're simply observing and listening in on conversations happening over the wire. In contrast, ARP poisoning is an active technique that involves manipulating the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table to redirect traffic through a malicious device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's talk about the tool we'll use for this exercise: Wireshark. It's a popular network protocol analyzer that allows us to capture and analyze network traffic. To get started with PAC, you'll want to follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Install Wireshark on your penetration testing machine (PTM). You can download it from the official website: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html\n",
      "2. Start Wireshark and configure the interface that connects to your LAN. Once you've selected the correct network interface, click 'Start' to begin capturing packets.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. As traffic flows through the network, Wireshark will display a variety of information about each packet, including the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols being used. We're particularly interested in SMB (Server Message Block) traffic, as it is commonly used for file sharing and printing between Windows systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. To filter the captured packets to only show SMB traffic, type `smb` into the filter bar at the top of the Wireshark window and press Enter. This will help reduce the amount of noise in your capture and make it easier to find relevant conversations.\n",
      "5. Look for SMB sessions that involve the exchange of NetNTLMv1 or NetNTLMv2 hashes, which are used for Windows authentication. These hashes can be cracked offline using tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat to obtain plaintext passwords.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. To extract the captured hashes from Wireshark, you'll need to save your capture file first. Go to File > Export Specified Packets and choose a location to save the .pcapng file.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Once you have saved your capture file, you can use tools like `getntlm` or `responder` to extract the hashes from it. For example, using `getntlm`, you would run the following command in a terminal:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "tshark -r /path/to/your/capturefile.pcapng -T fields -e smb.nt_response > hashes.txt\n",
      "```\n",
      "This command uses TShark, which is the command-line version of Wireshark, to filter the capture file for SMB packets and output the NetNTLM responses to a text file named `hashes.txt`.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Now that you have your list of hashes, you can attempt to crack them offline using a tool like John the Ripper or Hashcat. Good luck!\n"
