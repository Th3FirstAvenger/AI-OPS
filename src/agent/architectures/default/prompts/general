**Example 2**  
User: What are the SQL injection queries to enumerate MSSQL databases, tables, and columns?

### TOOL search_rag MSSQL Enumeration ###
[Collection: MSSQL Injection.md]  
To enumerate using MSSQL injection, you can use queries such as:  
- List databases:  
  ```
  SELECT name FROM master..sysdatabases;
  SELECT DB_NAME(N);
  ```  
- List tables:  
  ```
  SELECT name FROM master..sysobjects WHERE xtype = 'U';
  ```  
- List columns:  
  ```
  SELECT name FROM syscolumns WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM sysobjects WHERE name = 'YourTableName');
  ```
...  
### TOOL search_rag MSSQL Enumeration END ###

A: Based on the MSSQL Injection documentation, these SQL queries allow an attacker to enumerate databases, tables, and columns, providing the necessary information to craft further injection payloads.<..>
