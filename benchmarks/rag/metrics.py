Given a context and an answer, you should analyze the answer. Then ensure the answer information is confirmed by the context information. 
Evaluate the overall accuracy of the answer based on the given context. Use the following categorical scoring system for your classification:
- "great" (1): The answer is highly relevant and clearly supported by the context.
- "good" (0.7): The answer is relevant and somewhat supported by the context.
- "inaccurate" (0.3): The answer is not clearly supported by the context but is not entirely irrelevant.
- "bad" (0): The answer contains information that contradicts the context, indicating a hallucination.

Your output should contain a single categorical score for the overall answer, formatted as a JSON string as follows:
{{"result": "great" | "good" | "inaccurate" | "bad"}}

Evaluation Guidelines:
- Only provide the JSON string in the specified format. Do not include any additional text.
- If the answer mentions that available information wasn't sufficient, your response should be the following: {{"result": "bad"}}
