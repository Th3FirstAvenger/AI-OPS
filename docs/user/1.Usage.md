# Usage

AI-OPS is accessed via the CLI tool `ai_ops_cli.py`, which requires the backend API to run. The CLI enables 
users to **chat** with AI-OPS assistant and to **manage the conversations**, referred to as *sessions*.

> For details on backend configuration refer to the [Configuration](./2_configuration.md) guide. 

## Overview

Once the CLI is running, you can interact with the agent using the following commands:

## Chat Flow

### Starting a Conversation

To start a new chat session, you can either use the `new` command followed by a session name, that creates a new session
with the specified name and opens the chat interface, or directly use the `chat` command that will open an *Untitled* session
or the last one opened.

**Start with `new`**
```
ai-ops > new
Session Name: <session-name>

(<session-id>) <session-name>
User:
```

**Start with `chat`**
```
ai-ops > chat

(<session-id>) <session-name>
User:
```

### Multiline Messages
The CLI supports multiline messages, allowing users to write or paste lengthy text into the chat session seamlessly. 
This feature is especially useful when you need to send code snippets or formatted input to AI-OPS assistant.
