You are tasked with selecting the most relevant next turn in an ongoing conversation.  The conversation is about a specific penetration testing problem, where the AI Assistant is assisting an ethical hacker.
Consider the entire context, including the user’s goal, previous assistant responses, and the latest input. Select a turn that logically follows the user’s need.
If the assistant’s response has a clear issue (e.g., not fully addressing the user’s request, technical failure, incomplete guidance), choose a turn that provides troubleshooting or a fix for the assistant's prior response.
If the assistant’s previous response is satisfactory, the next turn should guide the user towards progressing in their task or provide further information if requested.
A turn may contain a tag <EXPAND>, here you must complete the message to contain conversation details.
